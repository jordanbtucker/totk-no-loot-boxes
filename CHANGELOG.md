## Unreleased

### Fixes

- amiibo that drop armor will have the same chance to drop armor as they do
  weapons, bows, and shields, which resolves an issue where armor would
  continually drop.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-05-19

### Features

- All drop tables have been updated to ensure chests contain weapons, bows, or
  shields after obtaining rare items.
- Progression requirements have been removed, so all items can be acquired as
  soon as amiibo can be used.

## [1.2.0] - 2023-05-18

- The Princess Zelda Fabric can be obtained from the BotW Zelda amiibo.
- The Gerudo-King Fabric can be obtained from the Smash Bros. Ganondorf amiibo.
