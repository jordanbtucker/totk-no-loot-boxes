## [3.0.0] - 2023-07-13

### Breaking Changes

- No Loot Boxes v3.0.0 is only compatible with Tears of the Kingdom v1.2.0 and
  possibly later versions. No changes have been made to the amiibo drop tables,
  however the pack file that contains the amiibo data was updated, so a new
  version of this mod needed to be created. To use this mod with Tears of the
  Kingdom v1.1.x, use the latest v2 version of this mod.

## [2.0.1] - 2023-05-21

### Fixes

- amiibo that drop armor will have the same chance to drop armor as they do
  weapons, bows, and shields, which resolves an issue where armor would
  continually drop.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-05-19

### Features

- All drop tables have been updated to ensure chests contain weapons, bows, or
  shields after obtaining rare items.
- Progression requirements have been removed, so all items can be acquired as
  soon as amiibo can be used.

## [1.2.0] - 2023-05-18

### Features

- The Princess Zelda Fabric can be obtained from the BotW Zelda amiibo.
- The Gerudo-King Fabric can be obtained from the Smash Bros. Ganondorf amiibo.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-05-17

### Features

- Restored the ability to receive rare weapons, bows, and shields from amiibo
  chests.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-17

### Features

- Added the initial implementation of this mod.
